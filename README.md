//Here's a description of the provided Python code for traffic signal detection:

The code utilizes OpenCV (cv2) library to process video frames captured from a camera in real-time. It detects traffic signals by analyzing circular shapes using the Hough Circle Transform.

The main function in the code is `get_dominant_color`, which calculates the dominant color in an image using the K-means clustering algorithm. This function is used to determine the color of specific regions within the detected traffic signal.

The code sets up a window named "camera" and registers a mouse callback function (`onMouse`). The callback function allows the user to exit the program by clicking on the camera window.

Inside the main loop, the code reads frames from the camera and performs the following steps:

1. Converts the frame to grayscale using `cv2.cvtColor`.
2. Applies median blur (`cv2.medianBlur`) to reduce noise and smoothen the image.
3. Performs Hough Circle Transform (`cv2.HoughCircles`) to detect circular shapes (traffic signals) in the image.
4. If circles are detected, it selects the largest circle as the traffic signal based on its radius.
5. Extracts a square region of interest (ROI) around the detected signal.
6. Calculates the dominant color in the ROI using `get_dominant_color`.
7. Determines the traffic signal type based on the dominant color and the colors of specific zones within the ROI.
8. Displays the identified zones and the traffic signal type on separate windows using `cv2.imshow`.
9. Updates the `last_symbol` variable to keep track of the previously identified signal.
10. If a new signal is identified, it prints the symbol to the console.
11. Draws circles around the detected signals on the original frame using `cv2.circle`.
12. Displays the processed frame in the "camera" window using `cv2.imshow`.

Finally, when the user clicks on the "camera" window, the loop exits, and the program cleans up the windows and releases the camera resources.

This code can be used as a starting point for traffic signal detection applications and can be further enhanced or integrated into larger systems for traffic management or autonomous vehicles.

Note: It's important to have appropriate lighting conditions and clear visibility of the traffic signals for accurate detection and recognition.
